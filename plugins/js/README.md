# JS Plugins

This directory provides the default JavaScript plugins.

Each plugin may be built and installed from its `install` task or all may be built and installed by running `deno task build-install` in this directory.

Installation will place the plugins in `<config dir>/treefiddy/plugins/js/...`.
