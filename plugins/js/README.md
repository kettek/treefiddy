# JS Plugins
This directory provides the default JavaScript plugins.

Each plugin may be built and installed from its `install` package.json script or all may be built by running the `build_install.ts` script in this directory.

Installation will place the plugins in `<config dir>/treefiddy/plugins/js/...`.

## Requirements
  * Deno 2.4.0+
