# tree-filter

This plugin allows filtering of files in the tree. These must be defined via the `filterFiles` string array in the plugin's configuration. This plugin's configuration may be generated by issuing `plugin save tree-sort` in treefiddy's command prompt which will result in `<CONFIG/APPDIR>/plugins/js/tree-filter/config.yaml`.

Build and install to treefiddy's js plugins directory:

```bash
deno task install
```
